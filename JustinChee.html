            <p>Justin was born and raised in Vancouver BC. Ever since an early age, he's had an obsession with
              games and stories. They were able to make him smile, laugh, get sad, and sometimes they should left
              him in awe. It was no surprise that he grew up with an artistic yearning. He's dabbled in serval
              mediums and is now trying to take it to an interactive medium. Stories and games were the
              tools that had sculpted Justin to be who is today.</p>
