            <p>Nikita Cote was born in Montreal, QC and moved to Whistler when she was two. She has always had a
            love for computers and everything surrounding technology. She moved to Pemberton and lived there for
            ten years. After high school, her family moved back to Whistler. Although she is not a big skier, Nikita
            loves the small town atmosphere that Whistler has to offer. Other than her love of technology, Nikita loves
            anything to do with food. She loves to cook and bake anything that seems like a challenge.</p>
